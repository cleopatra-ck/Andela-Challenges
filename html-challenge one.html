<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>
<UL>
    <LI>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.  </LI>
    <LI> Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </LI>

         <header> JavaScript and Java </header>
         <P>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</P>
         <P>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</P>

     <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
         <header> Hello World </header>
         <P>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</P>
         <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName);
              }
              greetMe("World"); </code>
         <P>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</P>
         
     </section>
.
     <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
         <header> Variables </header>
<P>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</P>
<P>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</P>

     <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
         <header> Declaring Variables</header>
         <P>With the keyword var. For example,</P>
         <code>var x = 42.</code>

         <P>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</P>
         <code>x = 42.</code>

<P>With the keyword let. For example,</P>
         <code> let y = 13</code>
     </section>

     <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
         <header> Variable Scope </header>

         <P>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</P>
         <code>if (true) {
      var x = 5;
    }
    console.log(x);  // 5</code>
        
         <P> This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</P>

          <code>if (true) {
                let y = 5;
              }
              console.log(y);
              // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

     <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
         <header> Global Variables</header>
         <P>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</P>
